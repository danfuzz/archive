Note that Stuplates requires a Java runtime version of 1.4 or later, as it
uses some newer classes and methods, and the driver script is
Unix-oriented. You don't need to use the script though; you can just invoke
the jar file directly, in whatever way one does that on your platform.

Place the script bin/stu in a directory in your PATH (such as /usr/local/bin),
and place the library file lib/stu.jar in an adjacent lib directory (such as
/usr/local/lib).

Then run it like this:

    stu --source=<source-name> --output-file=<output-file>
    stu --source=<source-name> --output-dir=<output-dir>
    stu --type=<type> ...
    stu --profile-eval=<int> ...

You can give it a source file or a source directory (all of whose contents
will be processed). The source is taken to be a script or a template
depending on its extension (".stu" for script and ".stut" for template).
You can override this by specifying "--type=stu" or "--type=stut". If you
omit the --source option, then input is read from the console. In this case,
you must specify the type explicitly.

If you omit an --output option, then output will be written to the console. 
If you give it a source *file* and name an output *directory*, then the
output file will be placed in that directory and its name will be the same
as the source name but without the ".stu" or ".stut" extension.

If you supply the --profile-eval option, then the input file you specify
(must be a file, not a directory) will be parsed once but evaluated the
number of times specified by the option. This is to aid in profiling the
evaluation engine.
