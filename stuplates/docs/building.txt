Building Stuplates requires a Java compiler and Ant. The program uses library
features only available in JDK1.4 or later.

Ant is available here:

    <http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/>

As of this writing, the build works with Ant 1.4.1. 

If you want to be able to recompile the grammar files, you also need to
have ANTLR and the optional ant tasks. ANTLR is available here:

    <http://www.antlr.org/>

As of this writing, the grammars compile with ANTLR 2.7.2a2, but at least
one of them triggers a bug in ANTLR 2.7.1.

Once you have Ant installed, cd to the main source directory and type
"ant." The system should compile. You will be left with a bin and a lib
directory in the build directory. You can run the script to invoke the
jar file, or run the jar file directly.

Once you have built the main program, you can run ant in the "tests"
directory to run the (potentially illustrative) regression tests. If you
run a test and it gives you an error, then please report that fact as a bug.
