static web pages.</p>

<h3>Why is it "stupid"?</h3>

<p>Because it's not done yet. There are big holes. You will fall through
them.</p>

<h3>Why is it "stupid"?</h3>

<p>Because I spent a grand total of about 2 hours designing the thing,
and so said design is certainly half-baked.</p>

<h3>Why is it "stupid"?</h3>

<p>Because I took syntactic inspiration from <a
href="http://www.erights.org/">E</a>, but E is way more elegant than this
load of poo. You may want to think of this system as an exploration in
somewhat alternative syntax for E, but without all the secure distributed
computation stuff.</p>

<h3>Why is it "stupid"?</h3>
A. It's "stupid" as in "It's so easy, it's stupid."

<h3>Why doesn't it do ... ?</h3>

<p>Because it's stupid.</p>
