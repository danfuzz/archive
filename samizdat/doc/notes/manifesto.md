Manifesto
=========

JavaScript is the latest major language in the long-dominant Algol / C
tradition, and it has succeeded in capturing the mindshare of millions of
programmers. However, it suffers from major semantic shortcomings, which
will only be addressed from within its own ecosystem over an excruciatingly
long time, if ever.

Erlang successfully demonstrates the power of aligning the programming model
with the reality of networking and interprocess communication. Its
enthusiastic users notwithstanding, it comes from a syntactic tradition that
has never taken hold in the industry. Because of this, its very good semantic
ideas have languished.

There is an opportunity for a system applications language which follows the
dominant C tradition while providing semantics that more fully embrace how
intra- and inter-computer networking actually works.

The Samizdat project is one possible take on how to fill this gap.
