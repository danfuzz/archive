Conventions, Decisions, and Guidelines
======================================

This document is a repository for all the stuff about a project that
individually doesn't really matter very much, but in the aggregate is
very important in order to maintain consistency throughout. This includes
conventions and guidelines, for both prose writing and program code.

**Rationale:** For some topics, a bit of rationale is provided, in sections
marked such as this one, as guidance for what the author(s) were thinking at
the time of the decision. These are not intended to be exhaustive analyses,
and they are generally biased toward the "pro" side of the argument. For every
rationale for one decision, there is very likely a fine rationale for exactly
the opposite decision, and these rationale sections are not meant to quash
debate.

This document is not complete, nor perhaps will it ever be. The main reasons
something might get included here are because of a bona fide point of
contention or because of an observed inconsistency in need of remedy.
