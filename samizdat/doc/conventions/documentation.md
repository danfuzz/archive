Conventions, Decisions, and Guidelines
======================================

Documentation
-------------

### Format

Standalone documentation is to be formatted using Github-flavored Markdown.

**Rationale:** Markdown is widely understood (by people and tools), and
it is lower-friction than other standard(ish) choices, such as HTML.

More specifically, the Markdown variant is Github-Flavored Markdown (a/k/a
"GFM").

**Rationale:** The project is hosted on Github, and Github makes it easy
to read documents formatted this way.

### Miscellanea

The capitalization of JavaScript is "JavaScript."
