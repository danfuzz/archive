Samizdat Layer 0: Core Library
==============================

Constants
---------

The definitions in this section are all simple constant values, not
functions.

**Note:** This section only covers constants that are not described
elsewhere in the library documentation.

### Classes

Most of the classes described in this guide have corresponding global
variables with the same name. For example, `Bool` is bound to the class of
all boolean values.
