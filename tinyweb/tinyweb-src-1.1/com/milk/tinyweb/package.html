<body>
<p>This package contains a complete, but minimal, implementation of an HTTP
1.0 and 1.1 compliant web server. It is not intended to be ultra-efficient;
rather the tradeoff is in favor of simplicity and smallness (both code size
and memory overhead) over efficiency.</p>

<p>The server itself is mostly encoded in the class {@link
com.milk.tinyweb.TinyWebServer}. You will have to instantiate an instance
of it, one way or another. Once instantiated, you tell it how to process
requests by calling {@link com.milk.tinyweb.TinyWebServer#putDocument},
handing it various implementations of {@link
com.milk.tinyweb.DocumentHandler}. There are several concrete
implementations of this interface to cover some of the usual cases, but you
can implement your own too, for whatever you need.</p>

<p>The <code>examples</code> subpackage contains a couple of working
examples of how to use the package. That, along with the javadoc, are
hopefully enough for you to figure out how to get things going.</p>

<p>The <code>testing</code> subpackage contains JUnit-based tests. In order
to compile and run them, you will need to place a copy of
<code>junit.jar</code> (3.7 or later) in the <code>build/lib</code>
directory.</p>
