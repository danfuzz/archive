<h1 align=center>The MILK Kodebase: TinyWeb</h1>

<p>TinyWeb is a small HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 compliant web server, written in
Java, and intended to be embedded in other Java applications, to do
lightweight duty. It aims for smallness in code and memory usage, rather
than ultra-efficiency, and it is released under an MIT-style (aka
BSD-style) license.</p>
