TODO List for UberChat
----------------------

This list is in no particular order.

Specific bugs:
* Propagate name change fixes from irc to icb client -or- abstract out
the whole gafoofoo

Big-ticket items:
* Prefs
* more complete info (user info like idle time, email address; channel
info like who's moderator, etc.)
* make the actual chat window into a more real form
* command-line interface ("/msg", "/thinks", etc.)
* logging support
* some sort of scripting support
* some sort of "ignore" support
* full console gui

Nebulous items:
* move scroll-to-bottom stuff from LocusPanel into new base class; make
the debug window use it too
* redo icb input filter to be a bit cleaner structured (more like the irc
one); also, make icb stuff more asynch-friendly
* Thread safety
* event caching, probably a feature of ListenerList
* TextFieldWithHistory
* friends lists
* error handling: more and better
* make tree views more generic
* make real main panel
* make the existing protocol handlers better
* (visible) time stamps
* make the ui be able to beep on beeps
* afk/away support, including at the interface layer
* remember window positioning
* topicChanged event should be able to know who did the changing

Yeah, I thought about doing some sort of commandline stuff, but it
prolly won't happen till a lot more of the system is fleshed out.

>come up in the main chat window or in their own window.

I want to eventually have how messages appear be *very* configurable,
e.g., all channels and *most* private stuff in one window, but private
with person X in its own window, etc etc. Again, this is lower priority
than just the basics...like a prefs file that remembers your icb host
and port etc.!

>- when message windows pop up, if that window has been up before (i.e. if
>you've messaged that person already), have the window come up with the
>same size and location as it was when you closed it. (this one would rock
>hard)

I definitely want to do this, but I messed up a bit on the way messages
make their ways into the actual windows. This'll get fixed when I do
the other config stuff.

>- configuring color would be fun

...and the font and indentation behavior too. I already have the code
set up internally to be able to do this. It's just a matter of having the
dialog boxes and the prefs file to save your tweaking in.

>- since scrolling is a bit slow, maybe have it scroll when the text
>reaches 2-3 lines from the bottom.

I also need to redo how scrolling works at all. One major thing
I want is to be able to turn off auto-scroll-to-bottom when messages
come in.

>- being able to see people's email, idle time, and whether or not they are
>registered would rock.

Yeah, that's fairly high on my list right now. One of my problems is
figuring out how to get this to work in a generic-enough way to include
the useful info from the various different kinds of servers (icb, irc,
spacebar, etc.) without having too much cruft. E.g., icb is the only
server I know about that has this registered/unregistered distinction.
I don't want to have code for the UI that has to explicitly know
about registration, but I *do* want it to show up. I'm thinking along
the lines of an arbitrary property key-value sort of thing.

>if you dont want to hear this from me, just tell me to shut the funk up
>and be happy with what i got.

Please do continue to comment, but yes, do keep in mind that I know
it's still very rough and incomplete. And also keep in mind that I
have *real* work to do too!

That being said, my current tasks in approximate order are:

* Object editor system, which will be the underpinnings of all the prefs
editing stuff. This is a tricky thing to get right, but once I do, it'll
make a lot of other stuff a lot easier.
* Fix the underlying chat interfaces (error message stuff, user/channel
info, etc.).
* Redo the "create system" stuff to use the object editor.
* Make it able to save and load prefs.
* Make chat windows nicer (buttons for common actions, have user/channel
list, have controllable font/color/etc).
* Redo main window, pretty much from scratch.

Actually, the thing *I* want is for the program to insert a line
saying what time it is every N minutes. More prefs!
