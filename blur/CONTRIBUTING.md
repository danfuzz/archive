Contributing
============

Bug reports and patches gladly accepted at
<https://github.com/danfuzz/blur>.

Please be maximally specific with your bug reports. In particular,
please note what OS and version you are running. In addition, the
specific version of the `bash` tool you are using may come in handy.

The gold standard for a bug report includes a pull request which
adds a test that demonstrates the problem. The platinum standard
includes a PR with both a test and a fix.

See below about testing. Please make sure that your fixes don't
break existing tests. If an existing test is *wrong*, please fix
the test!

Thanks!


Testing
-------

Ha-ha, sorry! As of this writing, Blur is still very experimental, and
there are no tests. Please don't let that stop you from submitting PRs.
