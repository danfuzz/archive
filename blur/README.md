Blur
====

### "I'd rather write shell scripts than Makefiles."

Blur is a very small and simple target-driven (top-down) build system, with
(practically speaking) no dependencies: It is written entirely as a small
handful of Bash scripts, totalling about 1,200 lines.

As of this writing, Blur is mostly an experiment and a demonstration, and not
anything that's gotten much real-world use.

"Blur" doesn't stand for anything, and it's certainly not a reference to
the tool's blazing fast speed. It's just a description of how
the stream of tears affects its author's vision whenever he contemplates
having to use Make&hellip; or do build system work in general.
