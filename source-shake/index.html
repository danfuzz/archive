<h1 align=center>The MILK Kodebase: Source Shake</h1>

<p>Source Shake is a source-level tree-shaker for Java code. You give it a set
of "library" source and a set of "your" source, and it tells you which
files in the "library" are required by "your" files, or copies those files
to the directory you specify. It finds files in the library directly
required, as well as walking through the tree from those library files to
the files <i>they</i> depend on, etc.</p>

<p>This was originally written to be used with the
<a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> library, since for some reason the
ANTLR folks don't separate the tool from the libraries required by the
tool's output.</p>
