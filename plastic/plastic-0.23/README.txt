This is Plastic Sound.

See the doc directory for information about what this is all about.

This program is built using the ANTLR parser generator. This distribution
probably came with a precompiled grammar, but if you are interested in
recompiling it, then you'll need ANTLR. As of this writing, the grammar was
compiled with ANTLR 2.7.1. See <http://www.antlr.org/> for more details.

This program uses the javax.sound APIs. As of this writing, they are only
available with SUN's JDK 1.3.

This program uses the Java-Gnome libraries. As of this writing, they are at
version 0.5, and are very unstable. Don't expect greatness of the GUI at
this point. See <http://java-gnome.sourceforge.net/> for more details.

This release of Plastic Sound is very much pre-alpha. It is being
provided merely for the masochistically curious.

Please feel free to offer comments, suggestions, or advice, but do
note that this project is very much in its early stages. I already
have ideas about where I want it to go, but just haven't had the time
to flesh it out yet.

I hope you enjoy it.
