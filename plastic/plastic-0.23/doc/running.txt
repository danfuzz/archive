Running Plastic Sound
---------------------

If you've successfully built, then there will be two scripts in build/bin.
gplas runs the Gnome front end, which doesn't do much yet. plastic is the
interesting one. Call it with a single argument naming a file to load and
run. There are a bunch of working examples in the tests directory. As of
this writing, the most interesting ones (not that they're actually that
interesting, and in approximate order from most to least interesting) are:

    test-029.plas (run it when cd'ed to the main plastic directory)
    test-025.plas
    test-021.plas
    test-018.plas
    test-026.plas
    test-017.plas
    test-020.plas
