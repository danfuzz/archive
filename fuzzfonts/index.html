<h1 align=center>The MILK Kodebase: FuzzFonts</h1>

<p>FuzzFonts is a (small)
set of fonts. (Well, there's only one font right now, but I hope to make
more!) These are offered with the usual (MITesque) license:

<h2 align=center>Elseif</h2>

<p>Elseif is a programmer's screen font, meant for legible display on
high-resolution displays. I developed it because, when I upgraded my
video card to one that did 1600x1200, I was no longer able to find a
font which I found legible enough. The characters this font makes particulary
distinguishable are:</p>

<blockquote><code>I l 1 ! | [ { ( ) } ] O 0 8 B & @ ` ' , . : ;</code></blockquote>

<p>And, probably much to the chagrin of my brother, I made a point to 
make standard emoticons look decent (e.g., no off-center eyes).</p>

<p>This font is still a work-in-progress. As of this writing, only 15 point
medium and bold bitmaps are done, but there are no oblique versions at all,
nor is there a set of outlines.</p>
