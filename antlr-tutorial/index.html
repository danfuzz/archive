<h2 align=center>Extent Tracking, Tokens with Values, and Error Reporting</h2>
<h2 align=center>version 1.3</h2>

<h2 align=center>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a tutorial covering three different things that one often wants
to do with an <a href="http://www.antlr.org/">ANTLR</a> parser:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Maintain full extent information (start position and end position as
  well as file of origin) with tokens. In this case, it is used to make
  error reports more informative. As shipped, ANTLR only automatically
  keeps track of the start positions of tokens and doesn't know what
  file a token originally came from.</li>

  <li>Associate an arbitrary value with each token. In this case, they are
  used to hold the parsed values of literals and the intermediate results
  of computation.</li>

  <li>Label ASTs with tokens, rather than just with text and a token type.
  In this case, this functionality is used for a couple reasons, including
  using the token associated with an AST to hold the result of computing
  the expression it denotes and using the tokens associated with an AST and
  all of its children in order to report the full extent of an error.</li>
</ol>

<p>The code presented here was written to use ANTLR 2.7.1, so things
may not work if you are using an older version, or may work better if
you are using a newer version.</p>

<h2 align=center>The Example</h2>

<p>This tutorial is mostly embodied by the comments in the source code
itself, but it will help to know what this program actually
accomplishes.</p>

<p>The program, as its name implies, knows how to add. In particular, it
can add integers by performing a mathematical sum operation, and it can add
strings by performing concatenation. The same operator, <code>"+"</code>
suffices for both operations.</p>

<p>Additionally, it can convert numbers into strings, denoted with the
<code>"$"</code> prefix operator, and it can convert strings into numbers,
denoted with the <code>"#"</code> prefix operator. And, finally, one may
group operations with parentheses.</p>

<p>Number literals are simple a sequence of digits, optionally preceded by
a minus sign. String literals are a sequence of arbitrary 7-bit ASCII
characters, enclosed in double quotes, with several standard C-like
escapes (e.g., <code>"\n"</code>) supported.</p>

<p>A program in this language consists of a series of expressions, each
followed by a semicolon. The result of executing a program is that the
value of each expression is written to standard output, one per line.
String values are printed with double quotes around them, numeric values
are printed as-is, and any expression that contained an error is printed
out as <code>"(error)"</code>.</p>

<p>If any expression printed out as <code>"(error)"</code>, then before any
expression values are printed, there will be one or more error lines. Each
one is of the following form, which is identical to the form of a Caml
error (which the Emacs error parser already understands):</p>

<blockquote><code>File "<i>file-name</i>", line<i>[</i>s<i>]</i>
<i>start[</i>-<i>end]</i>, character<i>[</i>s<i>]</i> 
<i>start[</i>-<i>end]</i></code></blockquote>

<p>Below the error message, is the snippet of source that contains
the error, "underlined" by using dashes on the following line. For
example:</p>

<table align=center bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
width=85%>
<tr>
 <td><pre>File "test.txt", line 14, columns 8-17: Type mismatch for add operator.
  1 + ("foo" + 4);
       ---------</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The error messages are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>"Can only numberify strings."</code><br>
  This is issued if you try to apply the <code>"#"</code> operator 
  to an expression whose value is already a number.</li>

  <li><code>"Can only stringify numbers."</code><br>
  This is issued if you try to apply the <code>"$"</code> operator
  to an expression whose value is already a string.</li>

  <li><code>"Type mismatch for add operator."</code><br>
  This is issued if you try to apply the <code>"+"</code> operator
  to a string and a number, as opposed to a pair of strings or a pair 
  of numbers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an example input file:</p>

<table align=center bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
width=85%>
<tr>
 <td><pre>1;
  (2);
    #"3";
      $4;
        2 + 3;
      "s" + "ix";
    #"4" + 3;
  "e" + $(-1 + 2) + "ght";
#("4" + "2") + -33;
  #10;
    $"eleven";
      12 + "twelve";
    "thirteen" + 13;
  1 + ("foo" + 4);
(1 +
2 +
3 +
4 +
5)
+
("foo" +
 "bar" +
 "baz");</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Here is the output it generates (assuming its name is
<code>test.txt</code>):</p>
  
<table align=center bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
width=85%>
<tr>
 <td><pre>File "test.txt", line 10, columns 3-6: Can only numberify strings.
  #10;
  ---

File "test.txt", line 11, columns 5-14: Can only stringify numbers.
    $"eleven";
    ---------

File "test.txt", line 12, columns 7-20: Type mismatch for add operator.
      12 + "twelve";
      -------------

File "test.txt", line 13, columns 5-20: Type mismatch for add operator.
    "thirteen" + 13;
    ---------------

File "test.txt", line 14, columns 8-17: Type mismatch for add operator.
  1 + ("foo" + 4);
       ---------

<h2 align=center>Building It</h2>

<p>In order to build this program:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Make sure your Java <code>CLASSPATH</code> includes both an ANTLR
  installation and the directory where the example source code lives.</li>

  <li>Run ANTLR on the file <code>"add.g"</code>.</li>

  <li>Compile all of the Java source files, including the ones just
  generated by ANTLR.</li>

  <li>Run the class <code>Adder</code> (in the anonymous, top-level
  package), giving it a source file as its commandline argument.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, on my machine, the ANTLR distribution is located in
<code>/usr/local/lib/antlr</code>, and I run the <code>bash</code> shell,
so I can do this:</p>

<table align=center bgcolor="#e0e0e0" border=1 cellpadding=5 cellspacing=1
width=85%>
<tr>
 <td><pre>CLASSPATH=/usr/local/lib/antlr:.
export CLASSPATH
java antlr.Tool add.g
javac -d . *.java
java Adder test.txt</pre></td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>A <code>Makefile</code> is provided with this tutorial, which may
work for you after a modicum of tweaking.</p>

<h2 align=center>Brief Tour of the Source</h2>

<p>Here is a list of all of the source files contained in this example, and
a brief description of each. See the comments in the files themselves for
more details.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code><a href="add.g">add.g</a></code>: The ANTLR grammar file.</li>

  <li><code><a href="Adder.java">Adder.java</a></code>: This just has the
  <code>main()</code> method for the program. I suggest that you start your
  tour of the code by reading this file.</li>

  <li><code><a
  href="ExtentLexerSharedInputState.java">ExtentLexerSharedInputState.java</a></code>:
  This is a subclass of the ANTLR-provided class 
  <code>LexerSharedInputState</code>, which is needed in order to expose 
  accessors for the current line and column and relay information about
  the name of the file being parsed.</li>

  <li><code><a href="ErrorFormatter.java">ErrorFormatter.java</a></code>: 
  This class just contains a static method that does the full formatting
  of error messages, including grabbing the text in error out of source
  files.</li>

  <li><code><a href="ExtentToken.java">ExtentToken.java</a></code>: This is
  a subclass of the ANTLR-provided class <code>CommonToken</code>, which
  has been augmented to maintain full extent information (start and
  end position, as well as file of origin).</li>

  <li><code><a href="Makefile">Makefile</a></code>: A simple Makefile,
  which works for me but probably won't for you, at least unless you edit
  the <code>ANTLR_HOME</code> definition.</li>

  <li><code><a href="test.txt">test.txt</a></code>: A simple test program
  to test the system with.</li>

  <li><code><a href="TokenAST.java">TokenAST.java</a></code>: This is a
  subclass of the ANTLR-provided class <code>BaseAST</code>, which, instead
  of storing text and type directly (as ANTLR's <code>CommonAST</code>
  does), simply points at a <code>Token</code> instance and refers to it as
  needed.</li>

  <li><code><a
  href="ValueExtentToken.java">ValueExtentToken.java</a></code>: This is a
  subclass of <code>ExtentToken</code> (above), which adds a field to
  contain an arbitrary value.</li>
</ul>
