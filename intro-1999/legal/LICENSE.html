  </ul></li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>3. Distribution Obligations.</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>3.1. Application of License.</b><br>The Modifications which You
  create or to which You contribute are governed by the terms of this
  License, including without limitation Section <b>2.2</b>. The Source Code
  version of Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms of this
  License or a future version of this License released under Section
  <b>6.1</b>, and You must include a copy of this License with every copy
  of the Source Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any terms
  on any Source Code version that alter or restrict the applicable version
  of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
  include an additional document offering the additional rights described
  in Section <b>3.6</b>.</li>

  <li><b>3.2. Availability of Source Code.</b><br>Any Modification which
  You create or to which You contribute must be made available in Source
  Code form under the terms of this License either on the same media as an
  Executable version or via an accepted Electronic Distribution Mechanism
  to anyone to whom you made an Executable version available; and if made
  available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain available
  for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became
  available, or at least six (6) months after a subsequent version of that
  particular Modification has been made available to such recipients. You
  are responsible for ensuring that the Source Code version remains
  available even if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is maintained by
  a third party.</li>

  <li><b>3.3. Description of Modifications.</b><br>You must cause all
  Covered Code to which you contribute to contain a file documenting the
  changes You made to create that Covered Code and the date of any change.
  You must include a prominent statement that the Modification is derived,
  directly or indirectly, from Original Code provided by the Initial
  Developer and including the name of the Initial Developer in (a) the
  Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an Executable version or related
  documentation in which You describe the origin or ownership of the
  Covered Code.</li>

  <li><b>3.4. Intellectual Property Matters.</b>

  <ul>
    <li><b>(a) Third Party Claims</b>.<br>If You have knowledge that a
    party claims an intellectual property right in particular functionality
    or code (or its utilization under this License), you must include a
    text file with the source code distribution titled
    <code>"LEGAL.txt"</code> which describes the claim and the party making
    the claim in sufficient detail that a recipient will know whom to
    contact. If you obtain such knowledge after You make Your Modification
    available as described in Section <b>3.2</b>, You shall promptly modify
    the <code>"LEGAL.txt"</code> file in all copies You make available
    thereafter and shall take other steps (such as notifying appropriate
    mailing lists or newsgroups) reasonably calculated to inform those who
    received the Covered Code that new knowledge has been obtained.</li>

    <li><b>(b) Contributor APIs</b>.<br>If Your Modification is an
    application programming interface and You own or control patents which
    are reasonably necessary to implement that API, you must also include
    this information in the <code>"LEGAL.txt"</code> file.</li>
  </ul></li>

  <li><b>3.5. Required Notices.</b> <br>You must duplicate the notice in
  <b>Exhibit A</b> in each file of the Source Code, and this License in any
  documentation for the Source Code, where You describe recipients' rights
  relating to Covered Code. <br>If You created one or more Modification(s),
  You may add your name as a Contributor to the file named
  <code>"CONTRIBUTORS.txt"</code> in the associated directory of the
  Covered Code distribution. If no such file exists, you may create
  one.</li>

  <li><b>3.6. Option to Offer Services.</b><br> You may choose to offer,
  and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Code. However, You may
  do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear than any such
  warranty, support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
  alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
  terms You offer.</li>

  <li><b>3.7. Distribution of Executable Versions.</b><br>You may
  distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if the requirements of
  Section <b>3.1-3.6</b> have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
  include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code
  is available under the terms of this License, including a description of
  how and where You have fulfilled the obligations of Section <b>3.2</b>.
  The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an Executable
  version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe
  recipients' rights relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
  Executable version of Covered Code under a license of Your choice, which
  may contain terms different from this License, provided that You are in
  compliance with the terms of this License and that the license for the
  Executable version does not attempt to limit or alter the recipient's
  rights in the Source Code version from the rights set forth in this
  License. If You distribute the Executable version under a different
  license You must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ
  from this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer
  or any Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
  and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer
  or such Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.</li>

  <li><b>3.8. Larger Works.</b><br>You may create a Larger Work by
  combining Covered Code with other code not governed by the terms of this
  License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a
  case, You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
  for the Covered Code.</li>

</ul>

<h3 align=left>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
  License with respect to some or all of the Covered Code due to statute or
  regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to
  the maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
  code they affect. Such description must be included in the
  <code>"LEGAL.txt"</code> file described in Section <b>3.4</b> and must be
  included with all distributions of the Source Code. Except to the extent
  prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be
  sufficiently detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to
  understand it.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>5. Application of this License.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This License applies to code to which the Initial Developer has
  attached the notice in <b>Exhibit A</b>, and to related Covered
  Code.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>6. Versions of the License.</h3>

<ul>

  <li><b>6.1. New Versions</b>.<br>Dan Bornstein ("Licensor") or his
  asignees may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time
  to time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.</li>

  <li><b>6.2. Effect of New Versions</b>.<br>Once Covered Code has been
  published under a particular version of the License, You may always
  continue to use it under the terms of that version. You may also choose
  to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version of the
  License published by Licensor. No one other than Licensor or his
  assignees has the right to modify the terms applicable to Covered Code
  created under this License.</li>

  <li><b>6.3. Derivative Works</b>.<br>If you create or use a modified
  version of this License (which you may only do in order to apply it to
  code which is not already Covered Code governed by this License), you
  must (a) rename Your license so that the words or phrases "MILK",
  "Kodebase", "Dan Bornstein", or any confusingly similar word or phrase do
  not appear anywhere in your license and (b) otherwise make it clear that
  your version of the license contains terms which differ from the MILK
  Kodebase Public License. (Filling in the name of the Initial Developer,
  Original Code or Contributor in the notice described in <b>Exhibit A</b>
  shall not of themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
  License.)</li>

</ul>

<h3 align=left>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN "AS IS" BASIS,
  WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
  WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED CODE IS FREE OF DEFECTS,
  MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE
  RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU.
  SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE
  INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY
  NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
  CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE
  IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>8. TERMINATION.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to cure
  such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. All
  sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive
  any termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must
  remain in effect beyond the termination of this License shall
  survive.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>9. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
  (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL THE INITIAL
  DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED CODE, OR
  ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON
  FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY
  CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL,
  WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
  COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED
  OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL
  NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
  PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
  LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION
  OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
  MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>10. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Covered Code is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in
  48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of "commercial computer software"
  and "commercial computer software documentation," as such terms are used
  in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
  C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End
  Users acquire Covered Code with only those rights set forth herein.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>11. MISCELLANEOUS.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
  matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
  unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
  necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
  California law provisions (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
  provides otherwise), excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. With
  respect to disputes in which at least one party is a citizen of, or an
  entity chartered or registered to do business in, the United States of
  America: (a) unless otherwise agreed in writing, all disputes relating to
  this License (excepting any dispute relating to intellectual property
  rights) shall be subject to final and binding arbitration, with the
  losing party paying all costs of arbitration; (b) any arbitration
  relating to this Agreement shall be held in Santa Clara County,
  California, under the auspices of JAMS/EndDispute; and (c) any litigation
  relating to this Agreement shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the
  Federal Courts of the Northern District of California, with venue lying
  in Santa Clara County, California, with the losing party responsible for
  costs, including without limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys
  fees and expenses. The application of the United Nations Convention on
  Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any
  law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
  construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>12. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Except in cases where another Contributor has failed to comply with
  Section <b>3.4</b>, You are responsible for damages arising, directly or
  indirectly, out of Your utilization of rights under this License, based
  on the number of copies of Covered Code you made available, the revenues
  you received from utilizing such rights, and other relevant factors. You
  agree to work with affected parties to distribute responsibility on an
  equitable basis.</li>
</ul>

<h3 align=left>13. Yumminess of Milk.</h3>

<ul>
  <li>While not all forms of Milk are commonly consumed by humans, many
  people find Milk to be a tasty part of their regular caloric intake.
  While this License does not require you to do so, it heartily encourages
  you to enjoy Milk's many splendors.</li>
