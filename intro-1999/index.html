<h1 align=center>The MILK Kodebase: The Statement</h1>

<p>I've long been a fan of open source software, from back when it was
still called "free software" and rms and the GNU organization were about
all there were in terms of "organized" efforts around the concept. Every so
often, I'd think about doing some volunteer work for GNU, but that never
materialized, unless you count posting/mailing an occasional bug
report.</p>

<p>However, all the while, I've been writing little utilities for myself
and sometimes for friends (and even relatives), which I've always happily
given away. Fast forward to 1999. I'd been running a vanity domain for
several years, but, for some reason, it never until then occurred to me
that my personal source code repository was worth putting up on the site.
It's not that I had a lot that's really of product quality to release to
the teeming masses, but still I figured that there's something of use to
someone in the mess.</p>

<p>I never felt totally comfortable with the GPL/LGPL because of the
administrative burden it seems to imply (that is, I don't really want your
patches per se, so don't send them to me) and, closet socialist though I
may be, the political view that it brow-beatingly espouses. I'm very glad
that some foresighted folks at Netscape came along and nailed out the MPL,
which I am fairly happy with. The <a href="legal/LICENSE.html">Milk
Kodebase Public License</a> is based on it (via one level of
indirection).</p>

<p>Anyway, long story short, the code contained here has been open source
in spirit since day one, and now it's officially so. I'm not much of a web
designer, but I <i>do</i> like my code. I hope you like it too.</p>
